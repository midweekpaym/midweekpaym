Having multiple credit card and other loan balances, often at very high APRs, can make it difficult to pay them down, often forcing you to make only minimum payments to avoid late fees. Debt consolidation loans can offer a way to roll all your balances into a new, lower-interest loan that makes repayment more manageable. Based on our analysis of the data we collected from 59 personal lenders and 45 data points, Discover offers the best debt consolidation loans because of its low interest rates, lack of origination fees, and quick funding times.
